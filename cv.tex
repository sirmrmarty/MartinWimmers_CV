% Summary
\addblocktext{Summary}{I am currently pursuing an MSc in Neuroscience, where my research focuses on stimulating the thalamus using transcranial ultrasound. My passion for neuroscience stems from its unique combination of two fields I am deeply interested in: Engineering and Psychology. I thrive in environments where I can create and innovate, and I am always eager to take on challenges, whether working independently or collaborating within a team. Iâ€™m comfortable diving into new situations with minimal supervision and excel at bringing ideas to life through a hands-on approach.}
